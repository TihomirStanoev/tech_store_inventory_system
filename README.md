## ðŸ’» Advanced Tech Store Inventory System

![pdas](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0a746f-49ac-4507-ade5-ba9624cab55a)


This project is a simulation of an inventory system written in Python, applying core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The system manages an inventory of various tech products, each with its unique characteristics and behavior.



## âœ¨ Key Features
This project demonstrates a wide range of OOP concepts:
* **Multilevel Inheritance:** A clear hierarchy is built where more specific classes inherit from more general ones (_**Product**_ -> _**Electronics**_ -> _**Laptop**_)..
* **Multiple Inheritance:** Classes like **Laptop** and **Smartphone** inherit functionality from several parent classes simultaneously (**Electronics, BatteryPowered, Connectable**) to avoid code duplication.
* **Encapsulation:** All class attributes are private, and access to them is controlled through properties (_getters and setters_), which ensures data validity.
* **Polymorphism:** The **get_details()** method is overridden in each class to provide specific information, allowing objects to be treated uniformly regardless of their specific type.
* **Mixins:** The **CapacityMixin** class is used for the centralized management of constants shared between different classes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized into logical modules for better readability and maintenance:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ products/

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ product.py

â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.py

â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project?

To run the simulation, it's recommended to install the dependencies from a requirements.txt file.

1. Create a _requirements.txt_ file in the root directory of your project. Add the following line to it:
```
python-dateutil
```
2. Install the dependencies:
Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main file:
```
python main.py
```
This will execute the simulation defined in the main_simulation() function, which creates products, adds them to the inventory, and tests the various methods of the system.


## Example Usage

The main.py file demonstrates how the different components of the system work together:
```
# --- main.py ---

# 1. Create an inventory
tech_store_inventory = Inventory("Future Tech Store")

# 2. Create a complex product (laptop)
laptop = Laptop(
    name="Ultrabook Pro X1", 
    price=2800, 
    battery_capacity_mah=5000, 
    processor="Intel Core i7-12700H", 
    ram=16
)

# 3. Add the product to the inventory
tech_store_inventory.add_product(laptop)

# 4. Generate a report (polymorphism demonstration)
print(tech_store_inventory.generate_stock_report())

# 5. Use specific methods
laptops_found = tech_store_inventory.get_products_by_name("Ultrabook")
print(f"Found {len(laptops_found)} laptop(s).")
```
